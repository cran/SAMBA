Description: 
    Health research using data from electronic health records (EHR) has gained
    popularity, but misclassification of EHR-derived disease status and lack of
    representativeness of the study sample can result in substantial bias in
    effect estimates and can impact power and type I error for association
    tests. Here, the assumed target of inference is the relationship between
    binary disease status and predictors modeled using a logistic regression
    model. 'SAMBA' implements several methods for obtaining bias-corrected
    point estimates along with valid standard errors as proposed in Beesley and
    Mukherjee (2020) <doi:10.1101/2019.12.26.19015859>, currently under review.
